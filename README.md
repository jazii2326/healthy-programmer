alerts a programmer to take water, do physical exercise and eye exercise time to time to become healthy
In this program we are managing time for drinking water, physical exercise and eye exercise, so that a user health may not get down due to continuously working, and sitting at a single place.
So, i made a little program that will track the time and it alerts for water time, eyes exercise time and physical exercise time
1- After every 20 minutes it alerts for drinking water
2- After every 30 minutes it alerts for eye exercise
3- After every 40 minutes it alerts for physical exercise

And it also stores all the information in a log file.

Requirments:
Audio file having similar name
for water = water.mp3
for eye exercise = eye.mp3
for physical exercise = physical.mp3
& for logs = mylogs.txt

Thats it!
